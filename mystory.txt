Someone showed me how to save a text file with the html extension.
In High School, I read tutorials online and built websites in my spare time.
One of my teachers asked me to build a website for them and I charged them $20.
That teacher referred me to a place that needed an assistant webmaster.
I made websites for myself in College.
I maintained the website for my College newspaper.
I was offered a full time job at Citrix.
