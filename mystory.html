        <h2>Someone showed me how to save a text file with the html extension.</h2>
        <p>In High School, a teacher said she was going to put together a "coding class" and we were going to learn how to make websites. We only had one meeting, but in that one meeting, she showed me how to open a file with Notepad, save it with the `html` extension, and load it into a browser. I was amazed that with any computer, I had the power to publish something to the internet!</p>
        <h3>Technologies Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Notepad</li>
            <li>Browser</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>High School Self Learning</h2>
        <p>In High School, I read tutorials online and built websites in my spare time. I didn't have internet at home, so I used the school library computers in between classes. I would search for "learn HTML" and then find tutorials online, which I would save onto a floppy disc, take home with me to complete on my computer at home. As I was building sites for fun, I frequently saw websites doing things that I wanted to learn how to do, so I would view the sorce and try to figure out how they did it. That is how I picked up CSS and Javascript for the first time. Eventually, I went through tutorials on Javascript as well and developed a rudimentary understanding of the Javascript basics.</p>
        <p>At the time, the easist way to put your website online for free was to use Geocities, or other free hosting websites. All of my earliest websites were hosting with Geocities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>View Source</li>
            <li>Code Stealing / Copy and Pasting</li>
            <li>Geocities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My first gig</h2>
        <p>One of my teachers heard that I knew how to make websites, and asked if I could build one for a project she was working on. I told her I could do it and charged her $20. She had the web space already reserved for the website, so all I had to do was upload it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Image Editing / Paint Shop Pro (Photoshop knockoff)</li>
            <li>FTP</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assistant Webmaster at Chico State Watershed</h2>
        <p>That teacher referred me to a place that needed an assistant webmaster. Before I knew it, they had hired me and I was helping the webmasterr manage their website and keep things up to date.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>Command line / Terminal</li>
            <li>Pico (terminal editor)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>College Website Fun</h2>
        <p>I made websites for myself in college. Most of them were fairly goofy, such as <code>yarrgh.net</code>, which got half a million views in its lifetime. My roommate had a website on his own domain, so I asked him how he did that and he showed me hosting, and I bought my first domain, <code>styleable.com</code> which for many years featured a photo of a frog and not much else.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web hosting</li>
            <li>Domain name registration</li>
            <li>FTP</li>
            <li>Server Side Includes</li>
            <li>PHP website templating</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>School Newspaper Webmaster</h2>
        <p>I was hired to build the website for the school newspaper. I had to not only design and build the website, but I had to transfer content from the newspaper files to the website every week, and back up the old weeks to an archive. This was a huge pain, so I wrote a PHP script that would automatically build the site out based on me copy/pasting the content in. That way, each week, all I had to do was copy and paste the information into the script, save some images, and run the "build" operation. The result was a finished website that I uploaded to overwrite the old one.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PHP templating</li>
            <li>Build and deploy processes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>First Full-time job</h2>
        <p>After graduating, I was offered a Jr. position at Citrix Online. I was vastly underqualified, but I think they liked my passion and interest in website building. I learned more in the three years I spent at Citrix than all of the years through High School and College combined, mostly because I had people that I could ask questions and tasks to challenge me.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IDE (UltraEdit)</li>
            <li>Code Repositories (Perforce)</li>
